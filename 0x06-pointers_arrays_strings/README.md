The 0x05.c pointer and arrays_string manipulations

Every time you declare a variable, the computer will reserve memory for this variable. The memory reserved will then store the value of the variable.

Depending on the type of the variable, the computer will reserve more or less memory. The size of each type is generally defined in bytes (1 byte = 8 bits, each bit being 0 or 1).

rrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer.

*** Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.

But, you can still use the name of the array in your code, and its value will be… the address of the first element of the array. Wait… WAT?

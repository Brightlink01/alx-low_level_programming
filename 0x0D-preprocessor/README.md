The C Preprocessor
The C preprocessor modifies a source code file before handing it over to the compiler. You're most likely used to using the preprocessor to include files directly into other files, or #define constants, but the preprocessor can also be used to create "inlined" code using macros expanded at compile time and to prevent code from being compiled twice.
This project is done for ALX SE mandator task on dail basis on macros
The advantage of a macro is that it can be type-neutral (this can also be a disadvantage, of course), and it's inlined directly into the code, so there isn't any function call overhead.
The tasks
0. Object-like Macro
1. Pi
2. File name
@the end of this project stundets are expected to understand the following concepts
What are macros and how to use them
What are the most common predefined macros
How to include guard your header files
